## Overview
Get an overall idea of the employees in a certain company. This project involves an analysis of an HR dataset using Tableau to uncover hidden trends and patterns. The dashboard provides insights into various aspects of HR data, helping stakeholders make informed decisions.

## Objectives
* Identify hidden trends and patterns in the HR dataset.
* Provide visual insights that can aid in strategic HR decision-making.

## Dataset
I used a secondary dataset that was downloaded from the Kaggle.
The Excel sheet has 9 attributes,
* Name
* Employee id
* Gender
* Education qualification
* Date of join
* Job title
* Salary
* Age
* Leave balance

## Analysis
Used 5 number of charts to create the dashboard

* bar chart- represents the distribution of the salary scale
* bar chart- identify the job title distribution according to gender
* Pie chart- number of male and female employees
* line chart- the behavior of the company's new recruitment
* Frequency table- identify who are the highest paying employees

## How to Use the Dashboard
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Tableau workbook (.twb file) using Tableau Desktop.
3. Interact with the various visualizations to explore the insights derived from the HR dataset.
